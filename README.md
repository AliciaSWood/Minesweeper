# Minesweeper

A classic Minesweeper game that is played in the Java console.

Navigate your way around a 10x10 grid, and see if you can successfully uncover the board - without landing on a mine, of course!

As this was my first project using Java there were plenty of challenges, with perhaps the most difficult problem being how to number tiles that were neighbours to a mine.

Updates to perform: Break into classes, uncover neighbouring blank tiles
